### Changed
- N/A

### Fixed
- **Translation Cache Duplicate Detection Bug**: Fixed incorrect duplicate detection logic in the file cache system that was preventing translations of the same source text to different target languages from being saved
  - Previously, the cache only checked if the source text was identical, ignoring the language pair
  - Now correctly checks both the source text AND the language pair (source→target) before treating an entry as a duplicate
  - Ensures that translating the same source text to different target languages (e.g., English→French and English→Italian) are both properly saved to cache files
  - Affects all translation providers that use file caching (Gemini, Google Translate, DeepL)

### Removed
- N/A

### Added
- Added Persian language support to the Gemini API and Google Translate translation services.
- Enhanced text display formatting for right-to-left (RTL) languages with improved punctuation positioning.

## [3.5.3] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- **Network Resilience System**: A comprehensive solution to prevent Windows network stack corruption that caused API delays to increase after extended use
  - Circuit Breaker Pattern: Automatically detects network degradation (>3s calls or failures) and forces a client refresh when issues are detected.
  - Periodic Client Refresh: Proactively refreshes the Gemini client every 30 minutes or after 100 API calls to prevent connection staleness.
  - Connection Cleanup: Scheduled maintenance every 20 minutes to clear connection pools and prevent the accumulation of stale connections.
  - DNS Cache Management: Hourly system-level DNS cache flushing (`ipconfig /flushdns`) to address Windows network stack issues.
  - This self-healing behavior eliminates the need for PC restarts to restore performance.

### Changed
- **API Logging Performance Optimization**: Eliminated an O(n) scaling issue in cumulative statistics calculation that caused increasing delays during extended use
  - Replaced file-based cumulative totals lookup with an efficient in-memory cache for OCR and translation operations.
  - Prevents log file reading overhead that grew progressively slower as usage history accumulated.
  - Maintains sub-second logging performance regardless of the application's runtime duration.

### Fixed

  - Fixed issue where OCR thread was artificially pausing between processing queued images, even when work was available
  - Resolved compound delay problem where adaptive scan interval increases were being applied twice (once in capture thread, once in OCR thread)
  - Restores consistent ~2-second translation performance, eliminating scenarios where delays could extend to 3+ seconds
  - Maintains proper natural rate limiting through API response times and thread pool capacity limits
- **Concurrent Call Limits Optimization**: Improved system stability and performance under load
  - Reduced maximum concurrent OCR calls from 10 to 8 for better resource management
  - Reduced maximum concurrent translation calls from 8 to 6 to prevent API saturation
  - Lowered OCR overload detection threshold from >7 to >5 active calls for more responsive load balancing
  - Updated thread pool sizes to match new concurrent call limits for optimal performance
- **503 Error Suppression**: Enhanced user experience during API overload scenarios
  - Added intelligent suppression of "503 UNAVAILABLE" errors from translation window display
  - Errors are still logged for debugging purposes but hidden from end users
  - Application continues working normally when Gemini API recovers from temporary overload

### Changed
- **Adaptive Load Balancing**: More responsive system load detection and management
  - OCR overload detection now triggers at >5 active calls instead of >7 for earlier intervention
  - Improved load recovery threshold remains at <5 active calls for stable operation
  - Enhanced system responsiveness during high API usage periods

### Added
- N/A

### Removed
- **Redundant OCR Thread Delays**: Removed unnecessary artificial sleep intervals that were compounding translation delays

## [3.5.1] - 2025-08-03
